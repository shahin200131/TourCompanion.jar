        <h2>First Blog</h2>
        <p class="blog">Islam (/ˈɪzlɑːm/;[6] Arabic: ۘالِإسْلَام, al-ʾIslām, transl. 'Submission [to the will of God]')
            is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion centered on the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad, the religion's
            founder. Adherents of Islam are called Muslims, who are estimated to number approximately 1.9 <span
                class="ok">billion worldwide</span> and are the world's second-largest religious population after
            Christians.[7]</p>
        <h2>Second blog</h2>
        <p class="blog">The religion of Islam originated in Mecca about 610 CE. Muslims believe this is when Muhammad
            began receiving revelation. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.
            Muslim rule expanded outside Arabia under the Rashidun Caliphate and the subsequent Umayyad Caliphate ruled
            from the Iberian Peninsula to the Indus Valley. In the Islamic Golden Age, mostly during the reign of the
            Abbasid Caliphate, much of the Muslim world experienced a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. The
            expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and
            religious conversion as a result of Islamic missionary activities (dawah), and through conquests.</p>
        <h2>Third blog</h2>
        <p class="blog">The two main Islamic branches are Sunni Islam (85–90%) and Shia Islam (10–15%). While the
            Shia–Sunni divide initially arose from disagreements over the succession to Muhammad, they grew to cover a
            broader dimension, both theologically and juridically. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49
            countries. Approximately 12% of the world's Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority
            country; 31% live in South Asia; 20% live in the Middle East–North Africa; and 15% live in sub-Saharan
            Africa. Muslim communities are also present in the Americas, China, and Europe. Largely due to having a high
            proportion of young people, and a high fertility rate, Muslims are the world's fastest-growing major
            religious group.</p>
